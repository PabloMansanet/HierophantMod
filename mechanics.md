# Mechanics

The Hierophant revolves around four different "themes" with their associated
keywords. In order to facilitate the tactical play around gold, his base relic
(Donation Box) makes it so you're never completely out of funds.

## Doubloons (gilded)

A doubloon is a normal, cost 0 ability with the following text:

- Exhaust: Draw 1 card. If Doubloon is not in the exhaust pile at the end of
  combat, gain 10 (20) gold.

Many other cards key off Doubloons (discarding, fetching, exhausting or
otherwise interacting with them) and most of these contain the "Gilded" keyword,
which reads:

- Gilded: When you add this card to your deck, add a Doubloon to your deck.

Doubloons are meant to provide a very direct risk/reward choice by providing
value at the end of the combat as an exchange for clogging your deck.

## Tithe

A few cards have the Tithe keyword, which reads:

- Tithe: You may pay for this card totally of partially with gold, at a rate of
  20 gold per missing energy.

Tithe cards tend to be very expensive for their power level, but enjoy the
flexibility of being able to spend gold to play them at an energy discount (or
even for free). Several of the Hierophant cards key off high energy costs, which
interacts well with Tithe.

## Piety

Piety is the Hierophant's take on an alternate kill condition, similar to the
Silent's Poison.

Piety is a buff you accrue on yourself. When your Piety exceeds a monster's
current HP at the end of your turn, that monster converts to the Hierophant's
religion and is peacefully defeated. Strategies can range from building up piety
exclusively to finish fights, to a hybrid between damage and piety.

However, dealing unblocked damage through an attack decreases your piety in 2.

Many cards that generate piety do so before attacking, so the hierophant may
actually benefit from focusing on enemies with active block, in order to build
up piety. This synergizes with other cards that give block to every participant
in the fight. 

Since Piety can be built upon regardless of enemy block and is inherently AoE,
the numbers are lower than average damage numbers and are generally modeled to
be around Poison levels.

## Vow

There is a category of powers called Vows, which impose a restriction on your
play in exchange for a benefit. Vows aren't inherently good or bad so they can't
be prevented through Artifact. A few cards key off the number of active vows.
